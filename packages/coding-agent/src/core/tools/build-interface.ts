/**
 * BuildInterface — the generative-UI tool's public surface.
 *
 * See: rusty/docs/prd/generative-ui-proposal.md §4.2 / §4.3.
 *
 * The model calls **one** tool. It supplies:
 *   - `intent`: natural language — "ask the user N questions and give me
 *     their answers" / "show a 3-column table" / "confirm this destructive op"
 *   - `data`:   the structured payload (questions list, table rows, …)
 *   - `responseShape?`: optional declaration of the response it wants back
 *
 * The model never sees the catalog, the rendered component, or the Layout
 * Graph IR. The **UI Harness** (an LLM, Oracle-routed in prod) translates
 * intent + data + responseShape into a LayoutGraph composed from the
 * catalog. The renderer mounts the graph in the TUI, collects user input,
 * resolves the tool with the user's response (or void if fire-and-forget).
 *
 * Flow:
 *
 *   model → BuildInterface({ intent, data, responseShape? })
 *         → harness(input) → LayoutGraph
 *         → renderer mounts in TUI, collects user input
 *         → tool resolves with response (raw envelope; shape coupling is a
 *           harness responsibility — see notes below)
 *
 * MVP note on response shaping: the renderer produces a flat
 * `LayoutResponse` (component-id → value). It is the harness's job to use
 * component ids aligned with the model's declared `responseShape`. We do
 * **not** transform the response in this tool for MVP; full schema
 * validation + transformation lands once the renderer is wired (Stage 3+).
