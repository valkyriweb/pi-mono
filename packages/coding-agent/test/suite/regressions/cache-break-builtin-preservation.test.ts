/**
 * Regression test for Fix #3 (cache-break-investigation-2026-05-16.md §7.3 c).
 *
 * Bridge cache-break log shows the seven core builtins
 * (Bash/Edit/Write/Grep/Read/find/listing) each REMOVED ~2,560× per 18d of
 * production traffic. The mechanism: extensions call setActiveTools() with
 * a curated list that doesn't re-include builtins, which under wholesale-
 * replacement semantics silently drops them from the active set. Each
 * removal invalidates the tools-slot of the Anthropic prompt cache.
 *
 * The fix: setActiveToolsByName preserves builtin and `alwaysLoad`-tagged
 * tools that were active before the call. Additive only — never adds a
 * tool that wasn't previously active, so `noTools: "builtin"` sessions
 * keep builtins inactive.
