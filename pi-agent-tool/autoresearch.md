# Autoresearch: Native Pi `agent` vs `pi-subagents`

## Objective

Compare actual current behavior, UX, reliability, and token/value tradeoffs between native Pi delegation and the installed `pi-subagents` extension.

The eval must not overfit the scorer. It should prefer real tmux captures where cheap, source-backed evidence where live child runs would spend paid tokens, and honest `pending`/`unavailable` notes where a requested surface is absent.

## Primary metric

- **actual_eval_score** (unitless, higher is better): composite score for real captures, filled scorecard, findings, isolation proof, task-agent lifecycle coverage, source probes, and honest limitations.

## Secondary metrics

- `startup_captures`
- `scenario_captures`
- `isolation_verified`
- `scorecard_rows_touched`
- `findings_sections_touched`
- `task_agent_coverage`
- `source_probe_coverage`
- `honest_limitations`
- `scorecard_evidence_rows`
- `evidence_file_coverage`
- `evidence_manifest_rows`
- `live_capture_links`
- `version_guard_verified`
- `token_evidence_rows`
- `native_zero_cost_captures`
- `removed_command_token_captures`
- `fallthrough_cost_cents`
- `token_evidence_verified`
- `python_syntax_ok`
- `scorecard_numeric_rows`
- `scorecard_numeric_cells`
- `scorecard_average_consistency`
- `scorecard_numeric_native_wins`
- `scorecard_numeric_subagents_wins`
- `scorecard_numeric_ties`
- `scorecard_analysis_rows`
- `scorecard_analysis_verified`
- `findings_alignment_rows`

## How to run

```bash
./scripts/capture-source-probes.sh
./scripts/capture-startup.sh native
./scripts/capture-startup.sh subagents
./scripts/run-tmux-scenario.sh native native-s06-doctor-live '/agents-doctor'
./scripts/run-tmux-scenario.sh native native-s05-status-live '/agents-status'
./scripts/run-tmux-scenario.sh native native-s07-ui-selector-live '/agents'
./scripts/run-tmux-scenario.sh subagents subagents-s06-doctor-live '/subagents-doctor'
./scripts/run-tmux-scenario.sh subagents subagents-s05-status-removed-live '/subagents-status'
./scripts/run-tmux-scenario.sh subagents subagents-s07-manager-removed-live '/subagents'
./autoresearch.sh
```

`./autoresearch.sh` emits `METRIC actual_eval_score=...` and all secondary metrics.

## Off limits

- Do not modify production Pi source for this evaluation.
- Do not use native `agent` in the `pi-subagents` arm.
- Do not use `subagent` or extension commands in the native arm.
- Do not run paid live child-agent tasks unless source evidence is insufficient and the cost is justified.

## Constraints

- Same thinking level across arms: `--thinking off` for cheap capture baseline.
- No live child-agent baseline. Removed-command probes may spend parent-model tokens if intentionally measuring fallback UX.
- All artifacts stay under `pi-agent-tool/`.
- Mark removed/unavailable surfaces honestly.

## What's been tried

- Fresh state initialized after clearing previous autoresearch files and captures.
- Source probes show native Pi now includes `/agents-doctor`, `/agents-status`, saved chains, and `/agents run/parallel/run-chain` scaffolds.
- Source probes show installed `pi-subagents` is `0.24.0` and removed `/subagents-status` plus the old manager overlay.
- Current native `agent` schema lacks the requested non-spawn task lifecycle actions; S09 is scored absent/pending.
- Removed `/subagents` and `/subagents-status` probes fell through to parent model turns; this is useful UX/token evidence but should not be repeated unless intentionally measuring fallback behavior.
- Next iteration added `evidence-manifest.md` plus scorer checks that every scorecard evidence path exists, every scenario has a manifest row, live captures are linked, and the `pi-subagents 0.24.0` removed-surface guard is preserved.
- Next iteration added `token-evidence.md` and scorer checks for native `$0.000` registered-command captures, two removed-command fallthrough token/cost captures, and aggregate $0.111 extension fallthrough cost.
- Next iteration added `scripts/check-scorecard-consistency.py`, `score-analysis.md`, and scorer checks that scorecard summary averages match computed values; this caught and fixed a stale `pi-subagents` UX average (3.2 -> 3.3).
- Next iteration added `scripts/check-findings-alignment.py`, `findings-alignment.md`, and scorer checks that prose winners align with numeric winners or have documented judgment-call exceptions (5 aligned, 4 intentional exceptions, 0 conflicts).
